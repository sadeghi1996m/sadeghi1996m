My research studies how the structure of signals and measurement systems can guide reliable signal recovery. During my PhD, I worked on the following connected topics.

## Blind separation of graph signals

We studied the graph decorrelation (GraDe) algorithm, which aims to separate latent graph sources by exploiting the information given by the graph structure.

A limitation of this method was identified: sample graph autocovariance matrices can be poor estimates of their expected values because graph signal entries are generally neither independent nor identically distributed across nodes (not i.i.d.). The assumptions that justify sample averaging for time signals do not automatically hold for graph signals, so the sample autocovariance matrices of the sources may lack the diagonal structure that GraDe relies on. We showed that outlier eigenvalues in the graph spectrum contribute to this loss of diagonality and proposed a method that removes their contributions, thereby improving joint diagonalization and source separation.

## Sensor placement under uncertainty

Where should sensors be placed to recover the signals of interest from noisy measurements? I developed a statistical framework that models source-to-sensor gains using Gaussian processes, allowing uncertainty and prior knowledge to enter the placement problem.

The framework uses mean squared error and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio criteria, with stochastic optimization to find informative sensor locations. I also investigated sensor placement for sparse signal reconstruction in underdetermined systems, where both measurement noise and the properties of the sensing matrix influence recovery.

## EEG and brain–computer interfaces

I applied this framework to electrode placement for P300-based brain–computer interfaces. The aim is to select useful electrode locations while accounting for variability between people and reducing calibration requirements.

Our subject-independent electrode placement method learns common spatial patterns across a population. A hybrid method combines this prior knowledge with available recordings from a new participant through a Bayesian update.

## Future directions

I am interested in graph machine learning, geometric deep learning, and statistical inference on graphs, especially in understanding their theoretical foundations and developing principled learning methods.
